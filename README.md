# TradeStation_Backtester
Developed and deployed a fully automated trading strategy using TradeStationâ€™s EasyLanguage, a Pascal-like scripting language optimized for systematic trading. The strategy was implemented on a TopStep simulated futures account and successfully achieved over 100% return, scaling the account from $4,500 to over $9,000 within a four-month period.
